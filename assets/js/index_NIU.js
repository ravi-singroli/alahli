I'm really stoked to be using Untitled Sans and Styrene! </p>\n\n<p>This is the sort of project I have a hard time figuring out how to showcase on dribbble but I'll try to keep you all posted on how it's going and hopefully it'll be online before too long.</p>","width":400,"height":300,"images":{"hidpi":"https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/22679/screenshots/3605595/frj.png","normal":"https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/22679/screenshots/3605595/frj_1x.png","teaser":"https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/22679/screenshots/3605595/frj_teaser.png"},"views_count":11604,"likes_count":1029,"comments_count":27,"attachments_count":0,"rebounds_count":0,"buckets_count":84,"created_at":"2017-06-27T06:15:43Z","updated_at":"2017-06-27T13:30:00Z","html_url":"https://dribbble.com/shots/3605595-Font-Review-Journal","attachments_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/shots/3605595/attachments","buckets_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/shots/3605595/buckets","comments_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/shots/3605595/comments","likes_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/shots/3605595/likes","projects_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/shots/3605595/projects","rebounds_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/shots/3605595/rebounds","animated":false,"tags":["fonts","swiss","timmons","typography","untitled sans"],"user":{"id":22679,"name":"Bethany Heck","username":"bethanyheck","html_url":"https://dribbble.com/bethanyheck","avatar_url":"https://cdn.dribbble.com/users/22679/avatars/normal/bethany2_bw.jpg?1402332328","bio":"Creative Director, UX and Visual Designer, typographic enthusiast","location":"First: Auburn, AL, Now: Seattle","links":{"web":"http://heckhouse.com","twitter":"https://twitter.com/eephusleague"},"buckets_count":1,"comments_received_count":2760,"followers_count":14230,"followings_count":1763,"likes_count":29344,"likes_received_count":60038,"projects_count":5,"rebounds_received_count":17,"shots_count":240,"teams_count":1,"can_upload_shot":true,"type":"Player","pro":true,"buckets_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/users/22679/buckets","followers_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/users/22679/followers","following_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/users/22679/following","likes_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/users/22679/likes","projects_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/users/22679/projects","shots_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/users/22679/shots","teams_url":"https://api.dribbble.com/v1/users/22679/teams","created_at":"2011-03-10T14:17:10Z","updated_at":"2017-09-14T10:49:29Z"},"team":null}},{"id":93290339,"created_at":"2017-08-11T12:36:06Z","shot":{"id":3727245,"title":"Yellow Fellow","description":"<p>Some lettering I was practicing with last year.
